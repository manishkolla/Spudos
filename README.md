# Spudos
Safety and speed at the palm of your hands
Inspiration
We wanted to encourage road safety awareness while improving and enhancing an everyday regular commuting service, Bus Transportation.

# What it does ?
Spudos does just the right thing by adding safety and reliability to commuting services like buses as it has been implemented, all this has been done with accurate pinpoint data collection from both passengers' and drivers' perspectives.

# How we built it ?
We used the features of HTML, CSS, and Javascript to achieve a mobile web application and medium to get our idea into the limelight. 
Alongside all that we used certain APIs like Google Maps integration for live location features and Zpeed live speed monitoring feature for this project.

# What's next for Spudos ?
Spudos integrates the geolocation features for both the live location and speed monitoring. 
Future wearables can have this safety feature seamlessly built in it with a use of a load of sensors that even our present-day tech wearables provide. 
Spudos can be much more by not just for speed regulation but also for passengers' safety on highways no matter what way of commuting it could be. 
Also, Spudos can use the features of google cloud services to handle the data handling part of the application which includes driver data and geolocation data.
